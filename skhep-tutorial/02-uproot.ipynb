    "# What is Uproot?\n",
    "\n",
    "Uproot is a Python package that reads and writes ROOT files and is *only* concerned with reading and writing (no analysis, no plotting, etc.). It interacts with NumPy, Awkward Array, and Pandas for computations, boost-histogram/hist for histogram manipulation and plotting, Vector for Lorentz vector functions and transformations, Coffea for scale-up, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uproot is implemented using only Python and Python libraries. It doesn't have a compiled part or require a specific version of ROOT. (This means that if you *do* use ROOT for something other than I/O, your choice of ROOT version is not constrained by I/O.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![abstraction-layers](img/abstraction-layers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of being an independent implementation of ROOT I/O, Uproot might not be able to read/write certain data types. Which data types are not implemented is a moving target, as new ones are always being added. A good approach for reading data is to just try it and see if Uproot complains. For writing, see the lists of supported types in the [Uproot documentation](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic.html#writing-objects-to-a-file) (blue boxes in the text)."

    "1.  Open it with Uproot, look around at what's in there, and then find the number of French employees who were at least 35 years old, and had one or two children. For bonus points, use `with uproot.open(...) as f:` instead of `f = uproot.open(...)` to follow best practices.\n",
    "2.  With the selection from the previous part, make a histogram of the employee grade with `np.histogram(np.array(data))`, and save it to a new ROOT file. (You might need to wrap the data with `np.array` due to a bug I found while writing this, but it might be fixed by the time you read this.)\n",
    "3.  Read back the file you just made. Open the histogram, use `to_hist()` to convert it to a `hist` histogram, and then plot it with `.plot()`.\n",
    "4.  If you are in a training event, right-click on the image, then click on \"Create New View for Cell Output\", then right-click on the image in the new view, then \"Copy Image\", and paste it as a reply in the Slack channel.\n",
